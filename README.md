# app

This project is generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.15.1.

I didn't feel the problem required an API. The app is simply divided into 3 sections: an input textarea, an output div and an error div for displaying invalid data. Paste in a blob of CSV pay information into the input section (left pane) and the calculation results will be displayed in the right pane (or errors down in the bottom pane).

## Setup

Be sure to `npm install` and `bower install` after checking out the code.

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview. Navigate to http://{your host}:9000 to view the app after running `grunt serve`.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
